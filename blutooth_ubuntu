Thanks for your help ! Make sure you restart pulseaudio service after installing pulseaudio-module-bluetooth using systemctl --user restart pulseaudio.service –

This worked for me on Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS. Thanks! –

if not already installed install pulseaudio-module-bluetooth, this will add the required pulse audio sink that is needed.

sudo apt-get install pulseaudio-module-bluetooth
Afterwards restart pulse

pulseaudio -k
pulseaudio --start
